# huha-tampermonkey

Tampermonkey scripts for the daily work in web apps such as Bugzilla.

This needs the _Tampermonkey_ browser extenstion which is available for all
major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera and probably more).

Text blocks for requesting y2logs and hwinfo and to remind users of our "How to
write a good bug report" documentation:

- `!y2logs`
- `!hwinfo`
- `!good-bug`

Each one will replace the keyword instantly with the corresponding text block,
including a hyperlink if appropriate.
